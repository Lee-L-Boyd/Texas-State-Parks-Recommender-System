Please see the MyParks/php/my_bot.php file for code that was used to load the database and make computations for TF/IDF and any normalization that was used.  
A working version can be seen on my server at 
atx.bileberry.net/MyParks/
Please note, this will only be available when my home computer is on and running at the house.
