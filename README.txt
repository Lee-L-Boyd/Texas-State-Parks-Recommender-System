This was a project that extracted information from websites to help users make decisions about which of the many state parks are available in Texas.  The assumption was that keywords in the texts about parks could give hints about the nature of the parks.  Please see the MyParks/php/my_bot.php file for code that was used to load the database and make computations for TF/IDF and any normalization that was used.
